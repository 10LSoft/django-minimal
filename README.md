# Django Minimal

The very first objective for this repo is to provide a small repo containing a
basics imports for django-ninja into a (of course) django environment.

This repository will be used always when I want to create an API using django
and django-ninja and, if you want, you can use it too!

Feel free to code something cool in here too!
